# Web-api developer challenge for Open Web Technology.


Implementation of the UC1, UC2 and UC3 uses cases.
    
To test the expected behavior run:

```$ docker compose up```

and connect to `http://localhost:8080`
    
Some data are already present if you let the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` env to `dev`.
    
## Further improvement:
- add unit testing
- implement UC4
- improve documentation
- do smaller commits...
